1. Clone and begin working through Javascript-Koans ( https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans ).

2. Create a Todo application!
  - Use jQuery and the things we've learned so far. You may also need to dive into some things we haven't covered; practice your google-fu!
  - Your Todo application should have the following features
      - Add a Todo to the list
      - Delete a Todo from the list
      - Mark a Todo as "completed"
      - Let the user filter the list so that...
          a. all todos are visible
          b. only the completed todos are visible
          c. only the unfinished todos are visible
